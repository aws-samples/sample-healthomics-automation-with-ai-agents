    "\n",
    "Strands Agents is a Python framework for building AI agents that can:\n",
    "- Use tools to interact with external systems\n",
    "- Maintain conversation context and memory\n",
    "- Work with multiple LLM providers (Bedrock, OpenAI, etc.)\n",
    "- Integrate with protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n",
    "- Deploy to various environments (standalone, container, Bedrock AgentCore, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent** - The core AI assistant with a specific role and capabilities\n",
    "2. **Model** - The underlying LLM (Claude, GPT, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Tools** - Functions the agent can call to perform actions\n",
    "4. **System Prompt** - Instructions that define the agent's behavior\n",
    "5. **MCP Integration** - Protocol for connecting to external tool servers\n",
