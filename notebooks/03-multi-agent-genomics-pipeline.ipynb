    "# 🧬 Multi-Agent Genomics Pipeline: Graph Patterns and Edge Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates advanced Strands Agents concepts by building a complete **Multi-Agent Genomics Pipeline** using the Graph pattern with conditional execution and quality gates. The goal of the agent is to take a sample ID for a cancer sample (tumor/ normal pair) as input and process that through multiple steps to identify the significance of any genomic mutations in that sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multi-Agent Patterns** - Graph, Swarm, and Workflow architectures\n",
    "2. **Graph Construction** - Building deterministic agent workflows\n",
    "3. **Edge Conditions** - Conditional execution based on agent results\n",
    "4. **Quality Gates** - Data quality assessment and flow control\n",
    "5. **Agent Orchestration** - Coordinating specialized agents\n",
    "6. **Production Deployment** - AgentCore deployment for multi-agent systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ What We'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete **Genomics Analysis Pipeline** with four specialized agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **🔍 Data Discovery Agent** - Find genomics data files\n",
    "2. **🔬 Quality Control Agent** - Assess data quality (with quality gate)\n",
    "3. **⚙️ Workflow Orchestrator Agent** - Run variant calling workflows\n",
    "4. **📊 Interpretation Agent** - Generate clinical reports\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🕸️ Multi-Agent Graph Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents are connected in a **directed graph** with **conditional edges** that create quality gates:\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **Nodes (Agents):**\n",
    "- **Entry Point**: 🔍 Data Discovery Agent\n",
    "- **Always Execute**: 🔍 Data Discovery → 🔬 Quality Control\n",
    "- **Conditional Execute**: ⚙️ Workflow Orchestrator (quality gate)\n",
    "- **Conditional Execute**: 📊 Interpretation Agent (completion gate)\n",

    "1. **🔍 → 🔬** (Unconditional): Always proceed to quality control\n",
    "2. **🔬 → ⚙️** (Conditional): `quality_passed_condition()`\n",
    "3. **⚙️ → 📊** (Conditional): `workflow_completed_condition()`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Edge Conditions (Quality Gates):**\n",
    "- **Quality Gate**: Analyzes QC results for phrases like:\n",
    "  - ✅ \"Data quality status: SUFFICIENT for variant calling\"\n",
    "  - ❌ \"Data quality status: INSUFFICIENT for variant calling\"\n",
    "- **Completion Gate**: Checks workflow results for:\n",
    "  - ✅ \"Workflow execution completed successfully\"\n",
    "  - ❌ \"Workflow execution failed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Execution Flow:**\n",
    "1. **Always**: Data Discovery finds genomics files\n",
    "2. **Always**: Quality Control assesses data quality\n",
    "3. **If quality passes**: Workflow Orchestrator runs variant calling\n",
    "4. **If workflow succeeds**: Interpretation Agent generates clinical reports\n",
    "5. **If quality fails**: Pipeline stops after QC with quality assessment\n",
    "6. **If workflow fails**: Pipeline stops after orchestrator with failure diagnosis\n",
    "\n",

    "## 📚 Part 1: Multi-Agent Patterns Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Multiple Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) isn't here yet meaning one agent probably can't do everything\n",
    "2. Individual agents can be specialized with crisp system prompts\n",
    "3. Agents with fewer tools use fewer tokens to 'understand' those tools\n",
    "4. Agents with simpler tasks can use simpler (and more cost effective) models or more specialized models\n",

    "- **Conditional execution** based on agent results\n",
    "- **Quality gates** and validation checkpoints\n",
    "- **Best for**: Structured workflows with clear dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Swarm Pattern**\n",
    "- **Collaborative agents** working together\n",
    "- **Dynamic task distribution**\n",
    "- **Shared context and memory**\n",
    "- **Best for**: Complex problem-solving requiring multiple perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Workflow Pattern**\n",
    "- **Sequential execution** with handoffs\n",
    "- **State management** between agents\n",
    "- **Error recovery** and retry logic\n",
    "- **Best for**: Linear processes with clear stages\n",
